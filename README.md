# Daisy Patch SM Based Arpeggiator

> A simple arpeggiator based on the Daisy Patch SM platform. This is a work in progress and is not yet complete. Also, heavily using AI to create this project, so use at your own risk.

## Instructions for AI

- CV 1v/octave input for the base key. This should be quantized.
- Gate input for the trigger - this will determine the BPM.
- To begin with, only use 1 gate trigger per 1/4 note. This will likely need to change later.
- To begin with, I would like to play 4 notes per input key - these can play up dominant 7th chords. For example a C7 would play C, E, G, Bb.
